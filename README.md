### Overview of the Online Banking System Project

#### Project Description
The Online Banking System project is a command-line Java application that provides essential banking functionalities. Users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, transfer money between accounts, view transaction history, and manage personal information.

#### Key Features
1. **Account Management**: Allows users to create new accounts with a unique account number and owner's name.
2. **Deposit Funds**: Users can deposit money into their accounts.
3. **Withdraw Funds**: Users can withdraw money from their accounts, provided they have sufficient balance.
4. **Transfer Funds**: Users can transfer money between different accounts within the system.
5. **View Transaction History**: Users can view a detailed transaction history for any account.
6. **Manage Personal Information**: Users can update personal information, such as the owner's name associated with the account.

#### How It Works
1. **User Menu**: The application displays a menu of options for users to interact with.
2. **Account Creation**: Users provide an account number and owner's name to create a new account.
3. **Depositing and Withdrawing Funds**: Users specify the account number and the amount to deposit or withdraw.
4. **Transferring Funds**: Users specify the source account, the destination account, and the amount to transfer.
5. **Viewing Transaction History**: Users can retrieve and view all transactions related to a specific account.
6. **Managing Personal Information**: Users can update the owner's name for a specified account.

#### Tools and Technologies
- **Java Programming Language**: The entire application is developed using Java.
- **Scanner Class**: Utilized for reading user input from the console.
- **ArrayList and HashMap**: Data structures used to store transaction history and account details, respectively.

#### Steps to Run the Program
1. **Set Up**: Ensure that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your computer.
2. **Code Implementation**: Copy the provided Java code into a file named `OnlineBankingSystem.java`.
3. **Compile the Program**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `OnlineBankingSystem.java`, and compile it using `javac OnlineBankingSystem.java`.
4. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program with `java OnlineBankingSystem`.
5. **Interacting with the System**: Follow on-screen prompts to perform banking operations like creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, transferring money, viewing transaction history, and managing personal information.

### Project Extension Ideas
- **User Authentication**: Implement a login system with usernames and passwords for added security.
- **Interest Calculation**: Add functionality to calculate and apply interest for savings accounts.
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Improve error handling for various operations to manage invalid inputs and transactions better.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX for a more user-friendly experience.
- **Database Integration**: Use a database to store account and transaction information for persistence across sessions.

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to Java programming, demonstrating practical applications of user input handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), and basic data structures like ArrayList and HashMap.
